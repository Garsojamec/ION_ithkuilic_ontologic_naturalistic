## Introduction
It is difficult and complicated to define what color and the act of observing color are.
There may be more ideas about what color is than there are colors we can see on a standard color wheel.
Yet, life finds ways to talk about the world through color - even if we all experience color in different ways.
This text is not about defining the phenomenon nor experience of color.
It is about ION's color system and how we refer to it.
But, to explain that, first we may need to establish some common ground very basic perspectives of color.
## Schema
### Source-Based vs. Abstract-Based
#### Source-Based
**Source-based** words are built from roots that indicate a visual, chromatic similarity.
Some people may say such words refer to specific colors or at least a specific ranges of colors.
In English, we may use words like "peach", "eggshell white", "garnet", and "coral" etc
But these words contrasts from the terms they refer to:
- Peaches and garnet change color.
- Not all eggshells are white.
- Different parts of a peach, garnet, and coral can vary in color.
- Garnets and corals are often very chromatically distinct.

In ION, color words that are source-based convey more than just a literal visual feature.
They express non-chromatic information based on the root.
One could say that something is "mint-colored".
This might suggest a certain shade of green.
But, it may also express a minty odor, being alive, freshness, or some other plant features.

More on this _ideachromacy_ later!

#### Abstract-Based
**Abstract-based** words point to a chromatic quality that is isolated from any particular material.
With these words there's a paradigm that's distinctive but coherent.
Different materials can be said to share a color or to differ in color.
For example in English, the following are often distinctively called "red":
- Healthy, Human blood
- Ripe Jabanero Peppers
- North American Cardinals
- Mars

ION's con-history lead to these abstract terms to be built around the HSL/HSV and Munsell Color System.
In the lore, scholars segmented the color wheel's hues into 12 main segments.
Through affixes that evolved from other words, one can specify hues, saturation, lightness, and value more finely.

## Attributing Color
- Viewing Conditions
- Chromatic-Impermanence
- Patterns
- Fuzziness
- Subjective Experience

## Ideachromacy
Analogous to Japanese's sound symbolism, ION has a rich set of mimetic words based on color.
These words imitate or broadly symbolize what they refer to by their roots.

Japanese has a large inventory of sound symbolic or mimetic words, known in linguistics as ideophones.[1][2] Sound symbolic words are found in written as well as spoken Japanese.[3] Known popularly as onomatopoeia, these words are not just imitative of sounds but cover a much wider range of meanings;[1] indeed, many sound-symbolic words in Japanese are for things that don't make any noise originally, most clearly demonstrated by shiinto (しーんと), meaning "silently". 


Phenomime
Psychomime

Phenomime (擬態語, gitaigo)
    words that depict states, conditions, or manners of the external world (non-auditory senses), such as "damp" or "stealthily".
Psychomime (擬情語, gijōgo)
    words that depict psychological states or bodily feelings.

### Adverbial
#### Vision-Independence
Consider this helpful metaphor - the shape and appearance of a cube.
A cube has a definite kind of shape.
In that way, it doesn't matter what perspective we take when looking at the cube.
One could talk about it using only math and pure logic.
For example, we could say the following:
- A cube has 6 faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges
- Each face shares an edge with 4 other faces
- All of the cube's edges are the same length

A person need not _experience_ seeing ( or feeling ) the shape to make sense of it.
This sense of the cube is **vision-independence**.

We can do something similar with "color".
For example, there are mathematical models that talk about color as spatial vectors and some as algebraic objects.
Through these models, a person can reason about colors they've never seen.
With these tools, we may even talk about "impossible colors" for humans ( or anyone ) to see.
At that point, are we really even talking about colors?
Maybe we are talking about _colorness_ - an attribute of what it means to be a color.

#### Perspective-Based



#### Visual Potential
, but we may not experience it all at once.
Depending on our perspective we may notice different things about a cube.
